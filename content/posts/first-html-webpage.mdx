## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need a basic understanding of using a text editor and navigating your computer's file system.

## Step 1: Open a Text Editor

Start by opening a text editor on your computer. You can use popular text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad or Notepad++

## Step 2: Start with an HTML Skeleton

Every HTML web page begins with a structure that defines its layout and content. Here's the basic structure you should start with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is your first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the components of this structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML you're using.
- `<html>`: The root element of your web page.
- `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the page, such as its title.
- `<title>`: The title that appears in the browser's tab or window.
- `<body>`: The main content area of your web page.
- `<h1>`: A top-level heading element.
- `<p>`: A paragraph element.

## Step 3: Understanding the Code

Each HTML element serves a specific purpose in structuring and presenting content. For instance:
- Use headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) to define the hierarchy of your content.
- Paragraphs (`<p>`) are used for text paragraphs.
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) are great for organizing information.

## Step 4: Save Your File

After creating your HTML code, save the file with a `.html` extension. For example, you can name it `index.html`.

## Step 5: Open in a Web Browser

To see your web page in action, simply double-click the HTML file you've just created. This will open it in your default web browser. You'll see your "Hello, World!" message displayed along with any other content you've added.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first HTML web page. This foundational skill is the starting point for building more complex and interactive websites using various web technologies. As you continue your journey in web development, you'll learn to add styling with CSS, interactivity with JavaScript, and even connect to backend services for dynamic content.

Remember, practice is key to mastering web development. Experiment with different HTML elements, styles, and layouts to create unique and engaging web pages.
